The stupid customized version of [OS Engine](https://github.com/notweuz/FNF-OSEngine) I made.

I don't really use Haxe for coding, so upgrading to the latest version of Psych Engine is most
likely not a posibility.

# Features!
* Everything from OS Engine
* Some Botplay Slowdown Fixes
* maybe some more to come idk

If you want to have a better experience, just use [JS Engine](https://github.com/JordanSantiagoYT/FNF-PsychEngine-NoBotplayLag/). It has WAY less lag, and is based on a newer version of Psych Engine.
